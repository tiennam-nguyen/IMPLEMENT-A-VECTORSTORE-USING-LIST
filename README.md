# IMPLEMENT-A-VECTORSTORE-USING-LIST
    Here I'll implement a VectorStore using two fundamental
data structures: the Singly Linked List (SinglyLinkedList) and the Dynamic Array List
(ArrayList). Each vector is represented as a singly linked list, while the entire collection of vectors is managed by a dynamic array list. This design simulates the storage and retrieval mechanisms of vectors in modern database systems.

- ArrayList Implementation:

✅ All methods implemented correctly

✅ Proper memory management (constructors, destructor, assignment)

✅ Correct exception handling with proper messages

✅ Iterator implementation complete and functional

✅ Growth strategy (3/2 factor) implemented correctly

✅ All bounds checking in place
